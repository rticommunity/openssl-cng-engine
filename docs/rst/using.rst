Using the engine(s)
===================

The main components that this project provides are the two dynamically loadable libraries.

The first one is called ``engine-bcrypt.dll`` and it is generated by the project called ``engine_bcrypt``. It is an EVP engine that leverages the CNG Cryptographic Primitives through OpenSSL EVP methods.

The second one is called ``engine-ncrypt.dll`` and it is generated by the project called ``engine_ncrypt``. It implements an OpenSSL STORE abstraction for Windows Certificate and Key Stores.

Both projects expose the required method binding functions for them to be used as dynamically loadable OpenSSL Engines. For more details on how to do the loading, see section :ref:`using_dynamic_loading_rst`.

The specific engine control commands implemented by each of the two libraries are described in section :ref:`using_engine_commands_rst`.

Both components have a number of error codes and associated messages defined. Whenever an error occurs, standard OpenSSL mechanism are used to communicate this to the invoking application. Section :ref:`using_errors_rst` gives an overview this.

Debug versions of the binaries support more extensive logging and tracing through standard Windows debugging message mechanisms. Section :ref:`using_debugging_rst` explains how to take advantage of this.

The OpenSSL suite comes with a number of commands, also called applications, that can be used to perform all kinds of tasks. The are invoked via the ``openssl`` executable. Section :ref:`using_openssl_commands_rst` explains how to leverage the engine(s) with those commands.
